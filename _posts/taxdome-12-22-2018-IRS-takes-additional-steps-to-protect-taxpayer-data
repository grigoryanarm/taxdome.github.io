# IRS takes additional steps to protect taxpayer data; partners with tax professionals

IRS announced about stopping its tax transcript faxing service beginning from February 4, 2019. Instead of it IRS will introduce a more secure alternative to taxpayers and tax professionals.

IRS focuses on finding better ways to protect taxpayer information and tax transcripts. Criminals by getting tax transcripts can use them to file fraudulent returns that are difficult to detect because they are almost identical to a legitimate tax return.

IRS also took another step to protect taxpayer data. In September 2018, the IRS started to mask personally identifiable information for each individual and entity listed on the transcript.

Even if all financial entries are visible on the transcript, tax practitioners bringing taxpayers into compliance by filing prior-year tax returns may need access to employer information, which is no longer available to taxpayers. In such cases, tax practitioners may request an unmasked Wage and Income Transcript.

## Alternatives for taxpayers for return preparation

There are several ways that taxpayers can obtain a copy of their tax transcript. It can be faxing, calling IRS to mail transcripts. But for faster service, taxpayers can just go to IRS.gov for Get Transcript Online, verify their identities and create an account.

## Alternatives for tax professionals for return preparation

Starting Jan. 7, 2019, tax professionals who contact the Practitioner Priority Service number may, with proper authorization, have an unmasked Wage and Income Transcript deposited in their e-Services secure mailbox.

Tax practitioners must [meet](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/steps-for-tax-professionals-to-obtain-wage-and-income-transcripts-needed-for-tax-preparation) certain requirements in order to use the secure mailbox option.

## Faxing and business tax transcripts

The Feb. 4, 2019, discontinuation of the faxing service applies to both business tax transcripts and individual tax transcripts. Tax professionals are able to get a business tax transcript through the e-Service Transcript Delivery System.
